# Hardy-Weinberg-Mk1
This is an algorithm based on the law of hardy-weinberg for population genetics, I made this by myself while I was studying the process an theorycal implications of the law. Its has limitations of only  2 alleles at the same time, but you can run it more times in case you need to process more alleles.It could be upgradable to reach more implications of the law, for example, trying to solve causes of mutations in a specific population, etc.
The variables are in spanish, because Im Argentinian, However you can modify it to meet your requeriments.
PD: It has a Chi-Square of 3.84 for 95% confidence, you should modify it to meet your requeriments.
